This repository forms the beginning of an experimental system - GetGlass.io.

It is intended to automatically install all of the dependencies for running an Ansible AWX installation, and assist in creating an instance.

Currently it has only been tested on Ubuntu 18.04, but should work on any Ubuntu LTS or mainline Debian release.
